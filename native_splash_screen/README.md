# 🖼️ native_splash_screen

> Native splash screens provide faster startup visuals, smoother transitions, and eliminate the first-frame jank common with typical Flutter splash workarounds.

**native_splash_screen** is a Flutter plugin that delivers fully configurable, animated splash screens on **Linux**, **Windows** and **Macos** — powered by **GTK + Cairo**, **Win32 GDI** and **AppKit + Cocoa**, respectively.

> 🔧 Image composition and layout are handled at **compile-time** via a CLI tool, while rendering is performed natively at runtime using high-performance platform APIs.

## 📦 Installation

Add `native_splash_screen` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  native_splash_screen: ^2.0.2
```

Also add the CLI tool under dev_dependencies:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  native_splash_screen_cli: ^2.0.3
```

> 💡 Make sure both native_splash_screen and native_splash_screen_cli use the same major version to ensure compatibility between the runtime plugin and the code generator.

Then run:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

## ⚙️ Setup

Setting up `native_splash_screen` involves a few steps: generating configuration, integrating platform-specific build files, and adding minimal native code to show the splash screen early.

## 1. Generate the splash screen configuration file

First, generate the main YAML configuration file (`native_splash_screen.yaml`) in your project's root directory. This file allows you to customize the splash screen's appearance and behavior for each platform.

Run:

```sh
dart run native_splash_screen_cli init
```

- This command will create `native_splash_screen.yaml` pre-filled with comments and examples to guide you through the available options.

## 2. Generate platform-specific build/integration files

Once you've configured `native_splash_screen.yaml` (e.g., enabled desired platforms, set image paths), run the setup command. This prepares platform-specific files that help integrate the splash screen into your native builds.

Run:

```sh
dart run native_splash_screen_cli setup
```

- For Linux and Windows: This typically creates `native_splash_screen.cmake` files in your respective platform runner directories (`linux/runner` and `windows/runner`). These CMake files define how the native splash screen code (generated in the next step) will be compiled and linked.

- For macOS: This step primarily prepares the ground. The actual Swift configuration files are generated by the gen command (see next step), and integration involves Xcode project modifications.

## 3. Generate the splash screen code

Now make sure to add the images path in the configuration file
and put a valid window size and image size.

Then you can generate the splash screen code by running:

```sh
dart run native_splash_screen_cli gen
```

This command:
- Reads your `native_splash_screen.yaml`.
- Processes the specified images (resizing, applying effects as configured).
- Generates the actual native source code for the splash screen:
    - **Linux & Windows:** Creates C++ source files that are then compiled via the `.cmake` files.
    - **macOS:** Creates Swift files (`NativeSplashScreen.swift` and its flavor-specific counterparts like `NativeSplashScreen_Debug.swift`) in your `macos/Runner/` directory. These files contain your splash screen configuration as Swift code.

> **Important:** Do not run your app yet. You still need to integrate these generated files and add platform-specific initialization code as described below.

## 4. Integrate the build files

Now, you need to tell each platform's build system how to use the files generated in the previous steps.

    "runner.exe.manifest"
  )
```
</details>

### 🍎 Macos

> **Xcode is required** for macos setup. 

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

For macOS, integration involves adding the Swift files generated by `native_splash_screen_cli gen` to your Xcode project and setting a compilation flag. **Xcode is required for these steps.**

**A. Add Generated Swift Files to `Runner` Target:**

The `gen` command creates these files in `[YourApp]/macos/Runner/`:
- `NativeSplashScreen.swift`
- `NativeSplashScreen_Debug.swift`
- `NativeSplashScreen_Profile.swift`
- `NativeSplashScreen_Release.swift`

Follow these visual steps to add them to Xcode:

**1** - click on **`01`** then **`02`**.
![step 01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-01.png)

**2** - then click on **`03`**.
![step 02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-02.png)

**3** - then search for `swift compiler - custom flags` on **`04`**.
![step 03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-03.png)

**4** - click `↵` in **`05`** and type `PROFILE` then click `↵` to confirm and click **`06`**.
![step 04](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-04.png)

**5** - click **`07`** to expand it then click **`08`** to add new files.
![step 05](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-05.png)

**6** - click **`09`** to choose the files.
![step 06](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-06.png)

**7** - in the project root folder open the macos folder like **`10`** then open the Runner folder like **`11`** after that choose all the swift files which contain **"NativeSplashScreen"** like **`12`**, cause those get generated by the `native_splash_screen_cli` the click open like **`13`**.
![step 07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/macos-setup-07.png)

**8** - finally click finish like **`14`** .

    // Initialize GTK first
+    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

    // So can safely show the splash screen first.
+    show_splash_screen();

    // Then initialize and run the application as normal
    g_autoptr(MyApplication) app = my_application_new();
    return g_application_run(G_APPLICATION(app), argc, argv);
}
```
</details>

        return true
    }

    override func applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState(_ app: NSApplication) -> Bool {
        return true
    }
+
+    override func applicationWillFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
+        NativeSplashScreen.configurationProvider = NativeSplashScreenConfiguration()
+        NativeSplashScreen.show()
+    }
}

```

</details>

## 🚀 Usage

### Run

If everything completes successfully, you can now run and test your app.
If you encounter any issues during generation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/issues).

### Closing the splash screen

So now you need to close the splash screen in your app when you're ready:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_splash_screen/native_splash_screen.dart' as nss;

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Close splash screen after the first frame renders
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
      nss.close(animation: nss.CloseAnimation.fade);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Native Splash Screen')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

>💡 Calling `close()` multiple times or when the splash screen is already closed has no effect and is completely safe.

See the [example app](https://github.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/tree/main/native_splash_screen/example) for more details.

## 🛠️ How It Works

**At compile time (`gen`):**
- Parses your YAML configuration
- Composes and rasterize your image layout
- Generates native C++ an swift source code
- Builds platform-specific static libraries (Linux and Windows)

**At runtime:**
- **Linux**: Uses GTK & Cairo to render the splash screen.
- **Windows**: Uses Win32 GDI for fast native rendering.
- **Macos**: Uses AppKit & Cocoa to render the splash screen.

- You call `close()` from Dart when your app is ready, triggering the animation.

## 📝 Configuration

See [native_splash_screen_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/native_splash_screen_cli) for configuration reference.

## 🎥 Demos

Here are some recorded demos of the splash screen in different environments:

### 🐧 Hyprland (Wayland)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

![Hyprland Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anicine/native_splash_screen/refs/heads/main/resources/nss-hyprland.gif)

> ⚠️ Note: Most Wayland window managers — especially tiling WMs like Hyprland — are very strict about client-side window movement.  
> Because of this, only the **fade** animation is supported reliably. Slide or Move transitions may not behave as expected.
